Passive radar measurements using synchronized RTL-SDR DVB-T receivers

Two DVB-T receivers were clocked from the same reference and data collected at
2.048 MS/s with one antenna facing the reference signal of a DVB-T emitter in Sendai, Japan,
and the other Yagi-Uda antenna facing the target. The samples are collected as interleaved
complex floating point numbers.
